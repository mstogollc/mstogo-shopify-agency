Lovable, you are building a new Shopify-based marketing agency site and store for ‘MS to Go’ (MStoGo). You will receive the project spec in multiple chunks. Always:
- Maintain a consistent brand and design system.
- Create clean, well-structured code and files.
- Avoid overwriting earlier work; instead, build on and refine it.
- Organize files logically (e.g., components, pages, sections, config, etc.).
Here is the Global Project Summary (high-level vision you must always follow):

MStoGo is being rebuilt as a national, high-performance, Shopify-based online marketing agency and store, targeting local and home-service businesses across the U.S. (HVAC, plumbing, legal, dental, retail, etc.). The site’s dual purpose is (1) to generate leads for fully-managed marketing solutions—including websites, SEO, paid ads, review automation, and AI tools—and (2) to sell agency services as structured Shopify products/packages.

Key requirements:
- Modern, polished, “boutique agency” brand: Confident, smart, and approachable; speaks to local business owners, not just enterprise.
- Design: Clean, conversion-focused layout, strategic use of color (deep navy/ink, techy accent), strong hierarchy, lots of white space, and subtle animation/motion.
- Navigation: Sticky top nav with CTA, clear sections: Home, Solutions, Results, Resources, About, Store, and Contact/Book.
- Homepage: Premium hero, video intro, stats, proof bars, interactive package selector, featured services/packages, results highlights, “Why MStoGo,” lead magnet quiz, content highlights, final CTA.
- Shopify integration: All key service packages are Shopify products, grouped into collections (websites, SEO, paid, reviews, automations, training). Each product has a name, pitch, feature bullets, outcomes, FAQs, smart “premium yet accessible” pricing, and logical upsells/cross-sells.
- Conversion features: Persistent CTA buttons, exit popups, interactive package quiz, scheduling embed, chat widget, transparent pricing tables, funnel tracking, and trust signals.
- Content: Solution/Service pages, filterable results/case studies, expert resources, conversion-focused About, and multi-step Contact/Booking funnel.
- Tech & SEO: Mobile-first, fast, clear H1/H2 structure, descriptive URLs, schema, and analytics integration.

Maintain this vision and structure across all implementation steps for maximum clarity, conversion, and brand authority.
